    * The permissions of the files were changed by removing the executable 
    rights on all users.

    Note: although apparently the permissions were changed on the local repo,
    they didn't change on the remote, because when I cloned the remote, the
    files had the old permissions.


TODO list:
    * Check compilation options: 
            -compilers 
            -optimization flags
    
    * What parts of the code can be parallelized? 

    * Profiling tools?

    * Possible integrators
